## Style Guidelines:

- A combination of a muted sky blue (#77B5FE) and a soft, desaturated mint green (#A7D1AB) creates a sense of calm trust, appealing to both students and sponsors.
- A clean, light lavender (#E6E6FA) provides a modern and gentle backdrop.
- Use a warm coral (#FF7F50) sparingly to highlight key actions and create a sense of optimism.
- 'Roboto', a font that supports Vietnamese characters well, and is known for its readability and contemporary style, suitable for headlines or body text. All menus, titles and system text will be in Vietnamese.
- Use clear, modern icons with a slightly rounded style to represent concepts like finance, education, and community.
- A clean and intuitive layout that clearly separates areas for students and sponsors, with a focus on whitespace for a less cluttered feel.
- Smooth transitions and subtle animations to enhance user engagement and provide feedback on actions.
